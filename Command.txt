I Created file .gitignore
And I added this file into git ignore by using the following commands:
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Exclude Command.txt using .gitignore."


mkdir Info
touch Info/InfoFile1 Info/InfoFile2
git add Info/InfoFile1 Info/InfoFile2
git commit -m "Added Info subfolder and files."

git config user.name "AmitKumar_INFO"
To add the Command.txt to version control we have to remove this file from .gitignore
After removing this file from .gitignore I added this file and commit to make available in the version control
I have used these following commands in order to do it
git add .gitignore
git add Command.txt
git commit -m "I removed the file called Command.txt from .gitignore and added to the repository"
